# CAVA module for polybar

[**Preview I**](https://short.sgruber.at/polybar_cava)

Inspired by this reddit post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Polybar/comments/kwsk2n/is_there_a_module_to_display_an_audio_visualizer/

### Requirements

- You have to have [cava](https://github.com/karlstav/cava) installed on your system in order for the python script to work

- [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) should be installed to use this project in your polybar, but as the script can either print to STDOUT or write to a FIFO, this project can pretty much be implemented in anything you want.

### Usage

- Place the script in `$HOME/.config/polybar/scripts/modules/`

- Add 
the example module config to your own polybar config
